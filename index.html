    <div class="about">
        <h1>Vision & Movement</h1>
        <p>Every year, nearly 1 million people are forced to amputate a part of their body so that a deadly disease or faulty limb does not prevent the rest of their body from functioning properly. So LINK is here to help. With LINK, no one will have to go through the pain of losing a limb ever again because prosthetic limbs will feel natural. We have designed a new & improved technology, which will connect your prosthetic limb directly to your brain so you are able to control your artificial body naturally.</p>

            <div class="about__card">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Losing a limb is one of the most painful procedures a person can go through, physically but mentally. We know that amputation requires a lot of strength. letting go of an important part of you that you've always had. We know that adjusting to life with a prosthetic limb when you previously had a real one is an extremely difficult experience</p>

            <div class="about__card">
                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <p>The technology we use to allow you to control your artificial limb as if they were real limbs is the Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). A BCI is a type of technology that can read signals sent by the brain and execute them in devices such as prosthetics. In other words, a BCI system can ultimately allow utilization of technological devices such as a prosthetic arm or leg using neural synapses.</p>

            <div class="about__card">
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>Thanks to BCIs, The inventions of many different prosthetics changed the culture amputees lived in by making amputees more socially acceptable and by helping them live a life that they do not have the capability to live anymore.</p>

            <div class="about__card">
                <h2>Tech Utilized</h2>
                <p>The type of BCI technology that LINK uses to allow you to control prosthetic limbs with just your mind is called electrocorticography, also known as ECOG. We use this BCI for our product because it has a phenomenal scale, high temporal resolution and is mildly invasive.</p>
